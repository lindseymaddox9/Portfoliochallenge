    <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>My name is Lindsey  Maddox  I am currently attending a full stack web development at the University of  Texas.  
        I have a Bachelor of Science degree from West Texas A&M and a post bachelorette in education.  
        I am a certified teacher of 17 years and am certified to teach every core subject in every grade. I currently hold four certifications.  
        I believe that integrity and work ethic as well as social skills play a huge part of my future success as a future web developer. 
        I enjoy solving problems and my mentality of never stop learning has helped me to continue to challenge myself.
        Outside of work I am a mother of three intelligent, kind, and all-around great children.  They range from the ages of 9-21!  
        I stay busy with being a single parent but in my free time I enjoy reading and playing volleyball with a fair amount of Evermerge.  
        I have decided to make a career change and have completely dedicated my time, energy, and financial resources to make this happen.  
        I am willing to do whatever is needed to be financially stable and happy in my personal and professional life.
